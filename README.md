Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock once. You must buy before you can sell it.

For example, given [9, 11, 8, 5, 7, 10], you should return 5, since you could buy the stock at 5 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars.

Implement a stack that has the following methods:

- push(val), which pushes an element onto the stack
- pop(), which pops off and returns the topmost element of the stack. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.
- max(), which returns the maximum value in the stack currently. If there are no elements in the stack, then it should throw an error or return null.

Given an unordered list of flights taken by someone, each represented as (origin, destination) pairs, and a starting airport, compute the person's itinerary. If no such itinerary exists, return null. If there are multiple possible itineraries, return the lexicographically smallest one. All flights must be used in the itinerary.

For example, given the list of flights [('SFO', 'HKO'), ('YYZ', 'SFO'), ('YUL', 'YYZ'), ('HKO', 'ORD')] and starting airport 'YUL', you should return the list ['YUL', 'YYZ', 'SFO', 'HKO', 'ORD'].

Given the list of flights [('SFO', 'COM'), ('COM', 'YYZ')] and starting airport 'COM', you should return null.

Given the list of flights [('A', 'B'), ('A', 'C'), ('B', 'C'), ('C', 'A')] and starting airport 'A', you should return the list ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'C'] even though ['A', 'C', 'A', 'B', 'C'] is also a valid itinerary. However, the first one is lexicographically smaller.

Implement an LRU (Least Recently Used) cache. It should be able to be initialized with a cache size n, and contain the following methods:

set(key, value): sets key to value. If there are already n items in the cache and we are adding a new item, then it should also remove the least recently used item.
get(key): gets the value at key. If no such key exists, return null.
Each operation should run in O(1) time.

Given a N by M matrix of numbers, print out the matrix in a clockwise spiral.
For example, given the following matrix:

[[1,  2,  3,  4,  5],
 [6,  7,  8,  9,  10],
 [11, 12, 13, 14, 15],
 [16, 17, 18, 19, 20]]
You should print out the following:

1
2
3
4
5
10
15
20
19
18
17
16
11
6
7
8
9
14
13
